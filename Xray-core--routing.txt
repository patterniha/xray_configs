Xray-core routing:
   
    State 1: The routing entry address is an IP:
	    
        That IP is always used in the outbound.

////
		   	
    State 2: The routing entry address is an IP with a domain:
		    
	This happens when the initial-entry-address in inbound is an IP and Sniffing is on and "use-sniffed-domain-in-routing" is true
			
	State 2.1: an ip-rule is matched:
			
	    The IP used in outbound unless "domainOverride" is true.
			
	State 2.2: a domain-rule is matched:
			    
	    The Domain is used in outbound unless "ipOverride" is true.
				
	State 2.3: a non-ip/domain-rule is matched:
			    
	    The IP is used in outbound unless "domainOverride" is true.
				
	State 2.4: no rule is matched:
			    
	    The IP is used in outbound (first-outbound).

////
					
    State 3: The routing entry address is a domain:
		
        State 3.1: the domainStrategy is AsIs:
			
	    That domain is always used in the outbound.
						
	State 3.2: the domainStrategy is IPOnDemand:
			
	    At the first encounter with an IP-rule or a rule whose "ipOverride" is true, the domain is resolved to IP(IP-list).
				
	    By encountering each rule the domain and all ips in ip-list is checked.
				
	    State 3.2.1: an ip-rule is matched:
			
		The first IP of the IP-list that has matched the rule is used in outbound, unless "domainOverride" is true.
			
	    State 3.2.2: a domain-rule is matched:
			    
		The Domain is used in outbound unless "ipOverride" is true and IP-list is not empty.					
				
	    State 3.2.3: a non-ip/domain-rule is matched:
			    
		The Domain is used in outbound unless "ipOverride" is true and IP-list is not empty.
				
	    State 3.2.4: no rule is matched:
			    
		The Domain is used in outbound (first-outbound).
				
				
	State 3.3: the domainStrategy is IPIfNonMatch:
			
	    if no rule is matched, the domain is resolved to IP(IP-list) and check again.
				
	    State 3.3.1: an IP-rule is matched:
			    
	        Impossible!				
											    			
	    State 3.3.2: a domain-rule is matched:
			    
		The Domain is always used in outbound					
				
	    State 3.3.3: a non-ip/domain-rule is matched:
			    
		The Domain is always used in outbound
				
	    State 3.3.4: no rule is matched:
			    
		Now, The Domain is resolved to IP(IP-list) and check again
					
		State 3.3.4.1: an ip-rule is matched:
			
		    The first IP of the IP-list that has matched the rule is used in outbound, unless "domainOverride" is true.
			
		State 3.3.4.2: a domain-rule is matched:
			    
		    Impossible!					
				
		State 3.3.4.3: a non-ip/domain-rule is matched:
			    
		    Impossible!
				
		State 3.3.4.4: no rule is matched:
			    
		    The Domain is used in outbound (first-outbound).
